Title: About me

#### Hello, my name is Alexander Kamyanskiy

I like Python programming language and I use it for more than 5 years every day
and like to use it for web development, 
for deployment technologies, for writing tests and many other cool things.

This blog I've created to remember things which I already did or learning now or will learn, 
I think it will be mostly articles about usage python for web development.

English is not my native language and feel free to correct me. Also my sorry if 
I write something wrong.
